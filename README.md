# DynoMark

Dynomark strives to be a markdown query language engine, similar to obsidian's
[Dataview plugin](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview).

This program can be used with editors like neovim, vscode and emacs to provide
a similar experience to Dataview (but very barebones for now).

## Installation

**You can download the executables here:**
- [Download for Windows](https://github.com/k-lar/dynomark/releases/latest/downloads/dynomark.exe)
- [Download for MacOS](https://github.com/k-lar/dynomark/releases/latest/downloads/dynomark-macos)
- [Download for Linux](https://github.com/k-lar/dynomark/releases/latest/downloads/dynomark-linux)

**Or if you want to build it yourself:**

Requirements:
- Go (1.22.5)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/k-lar/dynomark
cd dynomark/

# Compile the program
make

# Install the program
sudo make install

# If you want to uninstall the program
sudo make uninstall
```

> [!NOTE]
> For MacOS users:  
> If you want to install the program to `/usr/local/bin/` like `brew` does, you
> have to set the `PREFIX` variable to `/usr/local` like so:
> ```bash
> sudo make PREFIX=/usr/local install
> ```
> And to uninstall:
> ```bash
> sudo make PREFIX=/usr/local uninstall
> ```

> [!NOTE]
> For Windows users:  
> The simplest way for you to compile the program is to use the `go build` command:
> ```bash
> go build -o dynomark.exe
> ```
> And then you can run the program with `.\dynomark.exe`.
> If you want dynomark to be available as a command in your terminal, you have to add
> dynomark.exe to your PATH environment variable.

  like really
  really
  really
  long
- Item 4

### Ordered List

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item that's

## Code

Here's a sample code block:

```go
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, DynoMark!")
}
```
````

Here are some queries and their results:

List of files in the `examples/` directory:  
Query: `LIST FROM "examples/"`

Result:

```
- movie_reviews.md
- tasks.md
- test.md
```

Paragraphs from the `examples/movie_reviews.md` and `examples/tasks.md` files:  
Query: `PARAGRAPH FROM examples/movie_reviews.md, examples/tasks.md`

Result:

```
Some movie review stuff here.

This is a test markdown file to test the Dynomark parser.
```

List of tasks in the `examples/test.md` file:  
Query: `TASK FROM "examples/test.md" WHERE NOT CHECKED`

Result:

```
- [ ] Implement DynoMark parser

```

List of unchecked tasks in all .md files inside `todos/` directory, grouped by file path:  
Query: `TASK FROM todos/ WHERE NOT CHECKED GROUP BY [file.path]`

Result:

```
- todos/todo-1.md
    - [ ] Task 1
    - [ ] Task 3

- todos/todo-2.md
    - [ ] Item 1

- todos/todo-3.md
    - [ ] Other task 1
    - [ ] Other task 2
```

List of tasks in all .md files inside `todos/` directory, grouped by file name (max 2 groups with
max 3 results under each group):  
Query: `TASK FROM todos/ GROUP BY 2 [file.path] LIMIT 3`

Result:

```

```

All unordered list items in `examples/test.md` where the list contains the word "really":  
Query: `UNORDEREDLIST FROM "examples/test.md" WHERE CONTAINS "really"`

Result:

```

3. Third item that's
   kinda
   sorta
   long-ish
```

All tasks in `examples/test.md` but limit the results to the first 2:  
Query: `TASK FROM "examples/test.md" LIMIT 2`

Result:

```
- [ ] Implement DynoMark parser
- [x] Create test markdown file
```

All tasks in `examples/test.md` where the tasks contains either the word "unit" or "CLI":  
Query: `TASK FROM "examples/test.md" WHERE CONTAINS "CLI" OR CONTAINS "unit"`

Result:

```
- [ ] Write unit tests
- [x] Design CLI interface
```

All tasks in `examples/test.md` where the tasks contains either the word "unit"
or "CLI" and the task is not checked:  
Query: `TASK FROM "examples/test.md" WHERE CONTAINS "CLI" OR CONTAINS "unit" AND NOT CHECKED`

Result:

```
- [ ] Write unit tests
```

All fenced code blocks in `examples/test.md`:
Query: `FENCEDCODE FROM "examples/test.md"`

Result:

```
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, DynoMark!")
}
```

## Metadata support

Dynomark supports metadata in the form of key-value pairs. For now, you can use the
[dataview syntax](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/annotation/add-metadata/)
to add metadata to your markdown files. Currently only the standard metadata
syntax is supported and not the alternative "hidden" syntax (maybe in the future).
To reference metadata in your queries, you have to use the following syntax:
`[metadata_key]`

The only place where that syntax is not required is in the `TABLE` query,
where you can use the metadata key directly as shown in the examples below.

There are 10 metadata fields that are defined by default for every file it processes:
- `file.path`: The relative path to the file
- `file.name`: The name of the file, including the file extension
- `file.shortname`: The name of the file without the file extension
- `file.folder`: The folder of the file where it's located
- `file.link`: The markdown link to the file (relative to your current working directory)
- `file.size`: The size of the file in bytes
- `file.cday`: The creation day of the file in ISO8601 format
- `file.mday`: The modification day of the file in ISO8601 format
- `file.ctime`: The creation time of the file in ISO8601 format
- `file.mtime`: The modification time of the file in ISO8601 format

NOTE:  
IS is a strict version of the CONTAINS statement, it will only match if 
the metadata value is exactly the same as the argument after IS. It can
also be used with normal queries where CONTAINS doesn't cut it,
but that's rare because you would have to know the exact value of the
result you're looking for.

You can use metadata in your queries like so:
```
PARAGRAPH FROM "examples/" WHERE [author] IS "Shakespeare"
```

This will return all paragraphs from all .md files from `examples/`
where the metadata key `author` is `Shakespeare`.

## Tables

Dynomark supports querying metadata from files in a table format.

Here's an example query that queries all files in the `todos/`
directory by their creation date and their title:
`TABLE file.cday AS "Date created", title AS "Title" FROM todos/`

That would return a table like this:
```
| File      | Date created | Title   |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| todo-1.md | 2024-08-17   | Title 1 |
| todo-2.md | 2024-08-18   | Title 2 |
| todo-3.md | 2024-08-19   | Title 3 |
| todo-4.md | 2024-08-20   | Title 4 |
| todo-5.md | 2024-08-21   | Title 5 |
```

You can also use the `TABLE NO ID` statement to create a table without the ID/File column:  
`TABLE NO ID file.cday AS "Date created", title AS "Title" FROM todos/`

That would return a table like this:
```
| Date created | Title   |
|--------------|---------|
| 2024-08-17   | Title 1 |
| 2024-08-18   | Title 2 |
| 2024-08-19   | Title 3 |
| 2024-08-20   | Title 4 |
| 2024-08-21   | Title 5 |
```

And an example with metadata conditionals:  
`TABLE NO ID file.cday AS "Date created", title AS "Title" FROM todos/ WHERE [title] IS "Title 2"`

That would return a table like this:
```
| Date created | Title   |
|--------------|---------|
| 2024-08-18   | Title 2 |
```

The AS statement is optional. If you don't provide an alias, the metadata
key will be used as the column name.

**NOTICE: Before TABLE NO ID, there was TABLE_NO_ID that is now DEPRECATED. A warning will be shown
if you try using TABLE_NO_ID but it will still show the results. This syntax will be removed at a
later date, so please update your queries until then!**
